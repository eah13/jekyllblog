##So you'd like to contribute...
This website was built was part of a collaborative project. The project was started to fulfill a course requirement in Elliott Hauser's Programming for Information Professionals class at the School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

If you would like to make improvements or add functionality to the template, I welcome it. In fact, I would love for you to do so. Simply fork [the repository](https://github.com/landongrindheim/jekyllblog) on [github](http://github.com), make the changes on your own branch and submit a pull request. The pull request will be reviewed for congruity, then merged. Your changes may be aesthetic or functional in nature. I'm aware that the site is lacking. Check out the [open issues](https://github.com/landongrindheim/jekyllblog/issues) that need addressing.
