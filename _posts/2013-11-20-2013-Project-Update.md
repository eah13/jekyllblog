#Project Update

I've been working on the project for over a month now. Not all of that time has been spent on the blog, but a significant amount has been. I've modified the site's appearance quite a bit by using a Twitter Bootstrap CSS file. I've also been tweaking the CSS file and the HTML that calls on the the stylesheet. There's been quite a learning curve, even though we went over the very basics of Jekyll in class.

I've run into quite a few snags along the way. Most of these, like simply finding where the files can be viewed locally, have been resolved. Others are still the cause of confusion and frustration. Though I started the final project a while before it was brought up in class, I'm still not done. I imagine completion will occur near the end of the semester when there is no more time. These projects, anchored with milestones, could literally go on for years. I have already met several of the defined milestones.

One of the snags that continues to get me is my 'about' and 'contact' pages rendering as directories and not html pages. I could use a shortcut and add a slash to the locations, thereby calling on the index file located in the about or contact directory, but I'd prefer to have a little more mastery of the tools I've been using than that.
